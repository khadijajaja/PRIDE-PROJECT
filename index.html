                <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

                <p>With thrilling aerial moments, a compelling performance by Tom Cruise, and a catchy '80s music that emphasizes the action-packed plot, Top Gun rises as a classic in the action movie genre. The thrilling flight sequences and the connection between Cruise's Maverick and Iceman, played by Val Kilmer, demonstrate director Tony Scott's skill. While some character development is lacking and the movie leans heavily on its machismo, Top Gun's influence on pop culture and the pure excitement of its dogfighting sequences make it a must-see for action fans. ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The Earth's climate is undergoing significant and rapid changes due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This has led to a rise in global temperatures, resulting in more frequent and severe weather events, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems. Climate change poses a serious threat to the environment, human societies, and economies, impacting everything from food and water security to public health and geopolitical stability. Addressing this issue requires global cooperation, sustainable practices, and the development of clean energy solutions to mitigate its potentially catastrophic consequences.</p>
